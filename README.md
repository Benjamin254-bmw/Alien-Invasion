Let's buid a game!

Weâ€™ll use Pygame, a
collection of fun, powerful Python modules
that manage graphics, animation, and even
sound, making it easier for us to build sophisticated games. With Pygame handling tasks like drawing images to the screen, we can skip much of the tedious, difficult coding and focus on the higher-level
logic of game dynamics.

We will develope a 2D game in which the aim is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen in levels that increase in speed and difficulty.
